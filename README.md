Abstract  
In fast-paced betting games like virtual football, luck can give you a few wins in a row, temporarily boosting your balance. While the house always wins in the long run, you can aim for short-term profits (like +10 units) and stop before losses take over. Expected Upside Impact (EUI*) is a simple tool to help you pick the best betting options—ones where a win gets you closer to your goal fast. It combines how much you win with your chances of hitting your target, making it perfect for quick betting strategies.

1. Introduction  

Betting on games like virtual football is unpredictable—wins and losses come down to chance. Over time, the odds are stacked against you, but in short bursts, you might get lucky with a winning streak. The trick is to set a profit goal (say, +10 units), cash out when you hit it, and avoid losing it all back.  

Traditional tools like “expected value” tell you that you’ll lose in the long run. But for short-term betting, we need something different—a way to spot bets that can pay off quickly. That’s what EUI* does. It helps you find betting options where a win (or two) can make a big difference.

2. What is EUI*?  

EUI* is a score that shows how good a betting option is for reaching your profit goal quickly. Here’s the formula in plain English:  

EUI* = (Chance of Winning) × (Profit from a Win) × (Chance of Hitting Your Target)  

Breaking It Down:  

- Chance of Winning (p): How likely you are to win (e.g., 40% = 0.4).  

- Profit from a Win (d - 1): How much you make if you win (e.g., odds of 3.0 mean a profit of 2 units per 1 unit bet).  

- Chance of Hitting Your Target (P(T)): How likely you are to reach your profit goal (like +10 units) before losing too much (like -10 units).  


Think of EUI* as a way to rank bets. A higher EUI* means a better shot at quick success.

3. Why Use EUI*?  

EUI* is great if you:  

- Want to win a set amount (e.g., +10 units) and stop.  

- Bet in short sessions, not forever.  

- Play random games like virtual football.  

Unlike tools focused on long-term averages, EUI* zooms in on short-term wins. It helps you pick bets where a win pushes you toward your goal fast.

4. How to Calculate EUI*  

Let’s make this easy with three steps and an example.  


Step 1: Get the Odds (d)  

The odds tell you how much you win. If the odds are 6.0:  

- Bet 1 unit, get 6 back if you win.  

- Profit = 6 - 1 = 5 units.  


Step 2: Figure Out the Win Chance (p)  

This is your best guess at how often you’ll win:  

- Check past results (e.g., if a team wins 20 out of 100 games, p = 20/100 = 0.2).  

- Or tweak the odds’ “implied chance” (e.g., odds of 2.0 suggest 50% or 0.5, but adjust to 0.48 for the house edge).  


Step 3: Estimate Your Chance of Hitting the Target (P(T))  

This is trickier, but here’s a simple way:  

- Imagine betting until you hit +10 (profit) or -10 (stop-loss).  

- Use this shortcut:  

  P(T) ≈ [Chance of Winning × Profit] ÷ [Chance of Winning × Profit + Chance of Losing]  

- Or simulate it (more on that later).  


Example: Two Betting Options  

You want +10 units before losing -10. Compare these:  


Market A  

- Odds: 3.0 (Profit = 3 - 1 = 2 units)  

- Win Chance: 0.4 (40%)  

- Step 1: Profit part = 0.4 × 2 = 0.8  

- Step 2: P(T) ≈ [0.4 × 2] ÷ [0.4 × 2 + 0.6] = 0.8 ÷ 1.4 ≈ 0.57  

- EUI* = 0.8 × 0.57 = 0.46  


Market B  

- Odds: 11.0 (Profit = 11 - 1 = 10 units)  

- Win Chance: 0.1 (10%)  

- Step 1: Profit part = 0.1 × 10 = 1.0  

- Step 2: P(T) ≈ [0.1 × 10] ÷ [0.1 × 10 + 0.9] = 1 ÷ 1.9 ≈ 0.53  

- EUI* = 1.0 × 0.53 = 0.53  


Winner: Market B (0.53 > 0.46). One win in Market B hits +10 instantly, while Market A needs multiple wins.

5. Using EUI* in Real Betting  

Here’s how to put it to work:  

Pick Smart Bets  

- Calculate EUI* for each option.  

- Go for bets with EUI* above 0.4—they’re more likely to pay off fast.  


Test with a Simulation  

Imagine betting 1 unit each time:  

- Market A (Odds 3.0, 40% chance): Win = +2, Lose = -1. Might go: -1, -1, +2, +2, -1… (slow climb to +10).  

- Market B (Odds 11.0, 10% chance): Win = +10, Lose = -1. Might go: -1, -1, -1, +10 (hits +10 in one win!).  

High-odds bets like Market B can shortcut you to your goal.  


Check Your Strategy  

- Use past data or a quick simulation to see how often you’d hit +10 before -10.

6. Practical Tips  

- Virtual Football: Look for high-odds bets (e.g., odds > 5) with decent EUI*. They’re riskier but can win big fast.  

- Tools: Use a spreadsheet to calculate EUI* or a Python script to simulate bets.  

- Data: Base your win chance on real results, not just guesses.  


Quick Reference Table  

| Market | Odds | Win Chance | Profit | EUI* | Notes              |  

|--------|------|------------|--------|------|--------------------|  

| A      | 3.0  | 0.4        | 2      | 0.46 | Steady but slow    |  

| B      | 11.0 | 0.1        | 10     | 0.53 | Risky but fast     |

7. Limitations  

- Not Perfect: The P(T) shortcut isn’t exact—simulations are better for accuracy.  

- Win-Focused: EUI* looks at upside, so set a stop-loss (e.g., -10) to protect yourself.  

- Data Matters: If your win chance guess is off, EUI* won’t work well.

8. Conclusion  

EUI* = (Chance of Winning) × (Profit) × (Chance of Hitting Target) is a simple way to find bets that pay off quickly. It’s perfect for short-term strategies in random games like virtual football. By picking bets with high EUI*, you can ride a lucky streak to your profit goal and stop before luck runs out.
